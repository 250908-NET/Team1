Hello World!<br>
one two three four five<br>
this line is only filler<br>
and this is the end<br>
Morning dew glistens<br>
On petals soft as whispers<br>
Spring awakens slow<br>
How are you all<br>
Coding is fun <br>
Good bye <br>
by all!<br>
Sand snowy sand dunes<br>
A first, scaly lorry sneers<br>
enjoying the friend<br>
Poet I am Not<br>
Attempting will not end well<br>
lets stay in my lane<br>
Do re me fa so<br>
La de da <br>
something somthing something<br>
Hello World! This is Husan!<br>
Goodbye World!<br>
Goodbye World!<br>
