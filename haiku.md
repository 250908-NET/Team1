Hello World!
one two three four five
this line is only filler
and this is the end
Morning dew glistens
On petals soft as whispers
Spring awakens slow
Sand snowy sand dunes
A first, scaly lorry sneers
enjoying the friend
Poet I am Not
Attempting will not end well
lets stay in my lane
Do re me fa so
La de da 
something somthing something
Hello World! This is Husan!
Goodbye World!
Goodbye World!
